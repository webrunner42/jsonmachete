# jsonmachete README

Created by Marceline Shallow

## Features

Page backwards and forwards

## Possible future updates
* Make it editable, either through using a custom editor or a custom language handler.
* Highlight or navigate to that location in the actual document
* When launching, launch to the current record if any.
* Make it work with any level, not just the first order.
* Make it work with other heriarchal data formats such as XML.
